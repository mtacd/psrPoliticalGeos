# psrPoliticalGeos

*Code written by Tom Chen, updated by Drew Stanley.*

 Updates PSR with political geographies like NYC Council, NYS Assembly, etc.

 See Jupyter notebook for specific instructions on where to get this data.

**Note**: before running this script, make sure you first run the code that takes the PSR data and assigns parent asset lat/long coordinates to their child assets that do not have coordinates assigned to them.
