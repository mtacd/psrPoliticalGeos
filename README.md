# psrPoliticalGeos

*Code written by Tom Chen and Drew Stanley*
 
 Updates PSR with political geographies like NYC Council, NYS Assembly, etc.

*psrPoliticalGeos.py* is the only script that needs to be run. *psrLatLongUpdate.py* is a module that is called into the political geos script that updates PSR assets' lat/longs. 

ArcGIS files and other dependencies that the code needs to run are not included here - you would need to have those stored locally. This includes any of the spatial files for political districts.
